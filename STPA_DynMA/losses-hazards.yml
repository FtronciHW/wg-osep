#
# A system is a set of components that act together as a whole to achieve some 
# common goal, objective, or end. A system may contain subsystems and may also
# be part of a larger system.
#

SYSTEM:     Linux Kernel.
Boundaries: Kernel API, kernel space memory.

#
# A loss involves something of value to stakeholders. Losses may include a loss
# of human life or human injury, property damage, environmental pollution, loss
# of mission, loss of reputation, loss or leak of sensitive information, or any
# other loss that is unacceptable to the stakeholders.
#

Losses:
- Identifier: L-1 
	Text: Loss of or damage to elements outside the system (SW elements)
- Identifier: L-2
	Text: Loss of mission (the kernel does not provide correctly it services anymore) 
- Identifier: L-3
	Text: Loss of user satisfaction 

#
# A hazard is a system state or set of conditions that, together with a
# particular set of worst-case environmental conditions, will lead to a loss.
#
Hazards:
- Identifier: H-1  #availability
	Text: >
		The kernel does not respond to external input.
	Losses: [L-1, L-2, L-3]
  
	- Identifier: H-1.1
		Text: >
			The kernel does not allocate memory for a requester. 
      (eg. process, kernel thread, irq handler, driver, libraries...)
	
  - Identifier: H-1.2
		Text: >
			The kernel takes too long to allocate memory for a safety critical application.
	
  - Identifier: H-1.3
		Text: >
			The kernel does not deallocate memory for a requester.

  - Identifier: H-1.4
		Text: >
			The kernel takes too long to dallocate memory for a safety critical application.

- Identifier: H-2 #integrity
	Text: >
		The kernel does not maintain the integrity of the user space.
	Losses: [L-1, L-2, L-3]

	- Identifier: H-2.1
		Text: >
			The kernel allocates a memory space already allocated for another application. 

	- Identifier: H-2.2
		Text: >
			The kernel deallocates a memory space still needed to be used by an application. 
  
  - Identifier: H-2.3 
		Text: >
			The kernel allocates a subset of the requested user memory for a safety critical 
      application.

- Identifier: H-3 #integrity
	Text: >
		The kernel does not maintain the integrity of kernel data.
	Losses: [L-1, L-2, L-3]

	- Identifier: H-3.1 
		Text: >
			The kernel allocates a memory space already allocated for itself. 

	- Identifier: H-3.2
		Text: >
			The kernel deallocates a memory space still needed to be used by the kernel. 
    
  - Identifier: H-3.3 
		Text: >
			The kernel allocates a subset of the requested kernel memory for a safety critical 
      application.

- Identifier: H-4 #integrity
	Text: >
		The kernel violates the system boundaries.
	Losses: [L-1, L-2, L-3]

	- Identifier: H-4.1
		Text: >
			The kernel allocates an invalid memory space to be used by an application. 

	- Identifier: H-4.2 
		Text: >
			The kernel allocates an invalid memory space.

# One way to derive sub-hazards is to ask: What do we need to control to prevent this hazard?
# In our case: allocation and deallocation of memory 
#
# Note: Sub-hazards only for dynamic memory allocation
