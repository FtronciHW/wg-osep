#
# A system-level constraint specifies system conditions or behaviors that need
# to be satisfied to prevent hazards (and ultimately prevent losses)
#
# These constraints differ from controller constraints inasmuch as they
# describe how components in the system need to work together in order
# to prevent hazards.

Constraints:

- Identifier: SC-1
	Text: >
		If the kernel stops responding to external input, then such behavior must be 
		detected and measures taken to restore the system to its operational state.
	Hazards: [ H-1 ]

  - Identifier: SC-1.1
		Text: >
			The kernel shall allocate memory for a safety critical application in less than TBD us.
			Hazards: [ H-1.1, H-1.2 ]

	- Identifier: SC-1.2
		Text: >
			The kernel shall deallocate memory for a safety critical application in less than TBD us.
      Hazards: [ H-1.3, H-1.4 ]

- Identifier: SC-2
	Text: >
		The integrity of the user space memory shall be maintained by the kernel.
		Hazards: [ H-2 ]

	- Identifier: SC-2.1
		Text: >
			The kernel must not allocate a memory space already 
      allocated for another application.
			Hazards: [ H-2.1 ]

	- Identifier: SC-2.2
		Text: >
			The kernel must deallocate a memory space only
      when the application finishes to work on it. 
      Hazards: [ H-2.2 ]

  - Identifier: SC-2.3 
		Text: >
			The kernel shall allocate entirely the requested user memory for a safety critical 
      application.
      Hazards: [ H-2.3 ]

- Identifier: SC-3
	Text: >
		If the kernel data integrity is broken, such behavior must be detected 
    and measures taken to restore the system to its operational state.
	Hazards: [ H-3 ]

  - Identifier: SC-3.1
		Text: >
			The kernel must not allocate a memory space already allocated for itself. 
      Hazards: [ H-3.1 ]

	- Identifier: SC-3.2
		Text: >
			The kernel must deallocate a memory space only when finishes to work on it.
      Hazards: [ H-3.2 ]

  - Identifier: SC-3.3 
		Text: >
			The kernel shall allocate entirely the requested kernel memory for a safety critical 
      application.
      Hazards: [ H-3.3 ]

- Identifier: SC-4
	Text: >
		The kernel must not violate its boundaries.
	Hazards: [ H-4 ]

	- Identifier: SC-4.1 
		Text: >
			The kernel must allocate only valid memory section. 
      Hazards: [ H-4.1, H-4.2 ]
